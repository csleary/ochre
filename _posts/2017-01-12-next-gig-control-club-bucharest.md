I'll be performing in snowy Bucharest on 26th Jan as part of 'Experimental Night#3' at [Control Club](http://www.control-club.ro/), alongside Ulrich Schnauss, Architect, Ruxpin, BLN and Randomform. Pretty excited as it'll be my first trip to Romania. I look forward to being woefully inadequately dressed for the weather.

Tickets are available online [here](https://eventbook.ro/music/bilete-experimental-night-3-control-ulrich-schnauss-architect-ochre), and there's an event page on [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/events/1863191817237108/).
