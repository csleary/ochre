Tomorrow I'll be the 'Tunes for Zoon' guest selector on Zoon van Snook's Bloop London radio show, [_Oddtronica_](http://blooplondon.com/shows/zoon-van-snook-2/). I'll be picking five tracks that have recently been floating my boat, and will talk a little about each one. The show's always an interesting mix of tracks from the outer fringes of electronica, and is well worth a listen if you can make it.

The show airs from 18-20:00 GMT 🕕 on Sat 25th 2017. You can tune in and listen live over at [Bloop](http://blooplondon.com/).
