Sydney-based Dutch artist, Julien Mier, has recently released a new EP on Barcelona's Sin Hilo label. [_Untangle the Roots_](https://sinhilo.bandcamp.com/album/julien-mier-untangle-the-roots) includes my remix of Mier's track 'Well', and is one of four remixes capping-off the 10-track EP. As well as various digital options, it's available as a beautifully designed 12", pressed on white vinyl, and sleeved in a delightful translucent printed discobag. Excellent job on the design and packaging.

If you've never heard Julien's music before, you can expect playful, upbeat tracks full of jazzy chords, found sound percussion and sunny melodies. Over to the Bandcamp embed:
