I forgot to mention this here at the time, but I've also (fairly) recently remixed Karsten Pflum, reworking his track, 'I Am Ice'. It's taken from Pflum's excellent [_Love Canticles_](https://touched.bandcamp.com/album/love-canticles) album, released on Touched Music. As with all things Touched, all proceeds go to charity.
