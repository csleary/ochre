Be sure to check out Nate's [design breakdown](https://www.behance.net/gallery/73691191/Ochre-Project-Caelus) too, with sketches, alt. renders and timelapses of his incredible artwork. It's fascinating to watch his design process evolve from 2D sketches through to photo-realistic models and renders, creating a remarkable body of work in addition to the finished cover art.
