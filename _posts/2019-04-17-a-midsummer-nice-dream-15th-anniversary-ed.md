I'm sure the rather fetching image above is self-explanatory, but this year marks the fifteenth anniversary of _A Midsummer Nice Dream_, originally released on London's Toytronic Records in late 2004, now due for a spruced-up rerelease on Barcelona's Lapsus Records. Lapsus have been extremely supportive of my work over the years, so it's a pleasure to work with them to deliver a special rerelease of 'Midsummer' on double vinyl and digital.

The release is currently available for [preorder on Bandcamp](https://bandcamp.ochremusic.com/album/a-midsummer-nice-dream-15th-anniversary-edition) ahead of its June 7th release, with the physical release comprising double coloured vinyl and a beautiful full-colour print. The redesign has been handled by Nathaniel Reeves (marking another anniversary, incidentally -- ten years working together!), who has created a gorgeous and wonderfully intricate design for the sleeve and print insert. You can check out some more detailed shots of Nate's brilliant work on [his Behance page](https://www.behance.net/gallery/78840343/Ochre-A-Midsummer-Nice-Dream-2xLP).

I've also used the opportunity to bundle together some extra Midsummer-contemporary music, including a vinyl side of tracks that were previously only available online: 'In Waves', 'Indivisible' and 'The End of the Rise'. The digital edition features a further three bonus tracks: 'Airweight', 'Flexenbend' and 'Passing Landscapes'. All tracks have been remastered for the occasion by John McCaig, of panicStudios (who previously mastered _Like Dust of the Balance_ and _Petl_).
