      <p>The animated documentary I scored at the start of the year, <em>Centrefold</em>, has now been publicly released, so you can either watch the Vimeo embed below, or head over to <a href="http://www.thecentrefoldproject.org/">www.thecentrefoldproject.org</a> to watch and comment.</p>
<p>It's officially an award-winner too, winning 'Best Animation' at the <a href="http://www.scinema.com.au/">2012 SCINEMA Film Awards</a>!</p>
<p><em>Centrefold</em> has been busy sparking debate in the media, getting a mention on <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b01l0fwb">BBC Radio 4</a>, a feature in <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2012/07/24/vagina-surgery-why-are-so-many-women-desperate-to-have-designer-genitals-video_n_1697394.html">The Huff Post</a>, <a href="http://www.rudemagazine.co.uk/culture/the-rise-in-labia-surgery.php">Rude Magazine</a>, plus plenty of local media coverage around the North East. It's wonderful to see it making waves. If you're interested in following updates to the project, keep an eye on their <a href="https://www.facebook.com/thecentrefoldproject">Facebook page</a>.</p>
<p>Oh, and I hope you like the music/sound design, too!</p>

      <p>There's a nice little interview with me currently running at <a href="http://www.realeyesonline.net/"><em>Real Eyes</em></a> [<a href="http://www.realeyesonline.net/music/ochre/">direct link</a>]. As well as featuring excerpts from our dialogue, the article also includes quotes from previous interviews I've done (it's always odd reading old interviews; "did I really say that?"). Anyway, it makes for a nice primer on what I'm doing, why I'm doing it, and where I've come from.</p>
<p>While you're there, you may as well catch the interview with Hecq, too!</p>

      <p>I recently completed composing the soundtrack and sound design for <em>Centrefold</em>, a short animated documentary about labiaplasty. The film illustrates the personal accounts, hopes and fears, of three women following their decisions to undergo surgery. Here's the trailer:</p>
<p>http://vimeo.com/39853915</p>
<p>During the project I familiarised myself with <a href="http://www.camelaudio.com/">Camel Audio</a>'s excellent <em>Alchemy</em> synth, so you can expect to hear some evolving synth drones and sample-mangling pads in the score. <a href="http://www.imperfectsamples.com/">Imperfect Samples</a>' warm <em>Braunschweig</em> piano sample library also came in very handy, affording me the kind of warm, intimate piano chords that I can't seem to get enough of lately.</p>
<p>It was also superb fun being able to get my hands dirty handling the sound design for the film. Plenty of fabric-rustling, cutlery-clinking, field recording shenanigans involved, including the implementation of sophisticated GLOVEBIRD™ technology.</p>
<p>The full film's due for launch this summer, following its tour of film festivals.</p>
<p>You can visit the official Centrefold site over at: <a href="http://www.thecentrefoldproject.org/">www.thecentrefoldproject.org</a> and take a peek behind the scenes on <a href="https://www.facebook.com/thecentrefoldproject">the official Facebook page</a>.</p>

      <p>Followi<strong>n</strong>g tepid on the heels of 'E<strong>a</strong>rly Learning', I've recen<strong>t</strong>ly updated the <a href="http://ochre.bandcamp.com/">Bandcamp ed<strong>i</strong>tions</a> <strong>o</strong>f my remai<strong>n</strong>ing three <strong>al</strong>bums w<strong>i</strong>th 24-bit masters. <em>Like Dust of the Balance</em> has under<strong>g</strong>o<strong>n</strong>e a stra<strong>i</strong>gh<strong>t</strong>forward update to 24-b<strong>i</strong>t, re-dithered fr<strong>o</strong>m the origi<strong>n</strong>al track mont<strong>a</strong>ge. <em>Lemodie</em> and <em>A Mids<strong>u</strong>mme<strong>r</strong> Nice Dre<strong>a</strong>m</em>, meanwhile, have been remas<strong>t</strong>ered to 24-b<strong>i</strong>t from the original mixdowns, and so sound a bit more polished and refined. All albums <strong>c</strong>ontinue to be offered for <strong>a</strong> p<strong>r</strong>ice you deem fair.</p>
<p>Over in <strong>t</strong>he <a href="http://ochremusic.com/shop/">shop</a>, th<strong>e</strong> Ochre Spreadshirt stores have been updated with a new shirt option -- an ultra-so<strong>f</strong>t vint<strong>a</strong>ge fit, tri-blend, adje<strong>c</strong>tive-laden American Apparel Track <strong>t</strong>ee. I recently di<strong>s</strong>covered this c<strong>o</strong>mfy garment after receiving it in Bandcamp-print guise; it's the s<strong>o</strong>ftest tee I ow<strong>n</strong>.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, I'm excited to be working on the soundtrack for the animated documentary, <a href="http://www.thecentrefoldproject.org/">The Centrefold Project</a>, due for release during Spring 2012.</p>

Thanks to the help of some friends, plus some professional mastering, I can happily announce that <em>Early Learning</em> is now available for a name-your-price <a href="http://ochre.bandcamp.com/album/early-learning">download on Bandcamp</a>! (<a href="http://itunes.apple.com/gb/album/early-learning/id454545599">iTunes</a> etc. will follow over the forthcoming weeks.)</p>
<p>Although all the tracks have been previously released online in one form or another in the past, to collate and properly sequence them, give them a polish and adorn with some great <a href="http://ochre.bandcamp.com/album/early-learning">nkurence</a>-penned artwork, has breathed new life into them.</p>
<p><em>Early Learning</em> constitutes most of my pre-'Midsummer' output from between 2001 and 2003, and in some cases required revisiting the Cubase VST 5 song files, to be remixed and re-rendered for a cohesive release (i.e. tracks 1, 3 & 9). Being a download-only album, it seemed like a good opportunity to encode the FLACs in 24-bit, exceeding the 16-bit sound quality typical of a CD-borne album. (Which reminds me, I can also upgrade the FLAC editions of 'Like Dust', <em>Lemodie</em> and 'Midsummer' with 24-bit FLACs too. Shall arrange this when I get the chance.)</p>
<p>I've also taken full advantage of Bandcamp's bonus-bundling capabilities, uploading a couple of extra tracks (a remastered 'Bipolar Bears', plus my Zelda remix), in addition to Chris Larkee's video for 'Esign'. The Esign video has been updated with the remastered audio, and rendered to a 720p H.264/MPEG-4 video file.</p>
<p>Enjoy!</p>
<p>Please remember to hit those like/tweet buttons <a href="http://ochre.bandcamp.com/album/early-learning">on Bandcamp</a> and help spread the word. Much appreciated, thanks.</p>

      <p>I've finally finished updating my production <a href="http://ochremusic.com/portfolio/" title="Portfolio">portfolio</a>, following a few fevered QuickTime encoding sessions, showcasing most of the higher-profile work I've completed this year (plus some of my favourite projects from the past few years).</p>
<p>Initially I was a little reticent to combine my recording and production work under the 'Ochre' umbrella, but seeing as though the production side of things now (thankfully) makes up a sizeable portion of my working life (along with my mastering work), it seems to make sense now for my site to reflect this. It's also a good means of keeping my portfolio neatly catalogued, online and in one place, as I had almost forgotten about some the work I'd undertaken in the past (I'd been busier than I thought!).</p>
<p>Additionally, I've created a small library of available production tracks, which will hopefully serve both as a demonstration of my compositional versatility, as well as a catalogue of pieces that are available for licensing.</p>
<p>I'm very keen to expand my portfolio, particularly with some game audio work, so if you're an aspiring game developer in need of some music or sound effects for your game, please get in touch. Although I've licensed my music for use in games in the past, I'm really itching to get stuck in with some game audio production, interactive music and sound design, so I've been poring over various audio APIs, raising my proficiency with FMOD and Wwise.</p>
<p>Finally, I'll be dropping some news about some Ochre related releases over the forthcoming weeks, so stay tuned. Thanks!</p>
