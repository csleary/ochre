      <p>Hi folks. I've recently started work on a film soundtrack for <em>Dolls</em>, and currently have three pieces written to date, posted below. Feels nice to take off my Ochre hat from time to time, writing music tailored to the requirements of a specific project.</p>
<p><object height="145" width="100%"><param name="movie" value="http://player.soundcloud.com/player.swf?url=http%3A%2F%2Fsoundcloud.com%2Fochre%2Fsets%2Fdolls&amp;show_comments=true&amp;auto_play=false&amp;show_playcount=true&amp;show_artwork=false&amp;color=cc3366" /><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always" /><embed allowscriptaccess="always" height="145" src="http://player.soundcloud.com/player.swf?url=http%3A%2F%2Fsoundcloud.com%2Fochre%2Fsets%2Fdolls&amp;show_comments=true&amp;auto_play=false&amp;show_playcount=true&amp;show_artwork=false&amp;color=cc3366" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="100%"></embed></object>   <span><a href="http://soundcloud.com/ochre/sets/dolls">Dolls</a> by <a href="http://soundcloud.com/ochre">Ochre</a></span></p>
<p>I'll be posting more news as and when it trickles through, but if you'd like to actively stay in the loop with Dolls, we have a <a href="http://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=126610437355795">Facebook group</a> to join, as well as a dedicated <a href="http://filmcoalition.co.uk/brighton/blogs/posts/dollsfilm">film blog</a> for your bookmarks. If you're on Twitter, you can also <a href="http://twitter.com/dollsfilm">follow the Dolls team</a> on there, too.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, I'm feverishly trying to complete my uni work over the summer, as well as sorting out the next Ochre project. :)</p>

      <p>Yesterday, The Setup kindly published <a href="http://christopher.leary.usesthis.com/">a short interview with me</a>, detailing the gear I use in my daily musical exploits. It's a frank run-down of my minimal setup, what I love and loathe about the various software and equipment I use, plus some wish-list musings. Be sure to check out some of their other interviews, as there are quite a few big-hitters of the geek world on there too.</p>

      <p>Initial findings are promising, though we hope to carry out further research in order to fully ascertain the origin of <a href="http://ochremusic.com/shop/">the artefacts uncovered</a> so far. These appear to be cultural goods, most likely primitive digital commodities as were commonly available during the late 20th century (i.e. just prior to the so-called 'Blackout' period of dematerialisation). Initial theories of these artefacts as being part of a votive deposit have now largely been ruled out.</p>

If you fancy picking up Lemodie and Like Dust for just <em>four quid</em>, then you're in luck. Why not pick up some Christ. double vinyl for a couple of quid too? Talk about a sale. Wow.</p>

      <p>Last year San Diego-based games developer <a href="http://www.psyonix.com/">Psyonix</a> got in touch about licensing a couple of tracks in a tech demo/game called <a href="http://www.udk.com/showcase-whizzle.html">Whizzle</a>, showcasing the Unreal Development Kit. Being a demo, it's just a single level (for now, at least), but I'm glad it came to fruition nonetheless. Here's a short vid of Whizzle in action:</p>
<p><object width="520" height="317"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/vd6sXfxT9uc?fs=1&amp;hl=en_GB&amp;hd=1" /><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true" /><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always" /><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/vd6sXfxT9uc?fs=1&amp;hl=en_GB&amp;hd=1" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" width="520" height="317"></embed></object></p>
<p>If you're interested in learning more about the UDK and fancy dipping your toes into the world of game development, then <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s8ymbUmI36g">this video</a> of Dave at Psyonix gives you a quick intro to the platform. The UDK is free to download too, so given a little free time there's nothing stopping you from crafting your own titles.</p>

      <p>Nothing quite like opening your front door, wearing your dressing gown and slippers, to be met with disdain by a burly delivery man already four hours into his working day. Nice. Shortly after he'd finished looking me up and down with barely-disguised contempt, and informing me of eight boxes with my name on it, I was proudly standing in my hallway wondering where I could store 800 CDs.</p>
<p>I've already annoyed the staff and patrons in the local Post Office by shipping the dozen or so pre-orders, so they are now well on their way to their new homes! A big thanks is in order to everyone who pre-ordered -- I hope you received your instant downloads trouble-free (you've got to love Bandcamp!).</p>
<p>As usual, I've also sent a bundle of Lemodies to <a href="http://www.cdbaby.com/Artist/Ochre">CD Baby</a>, to make the postal fees a little easier on the pocket for US fans. I've added them to my <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Lemodie-Ochre/dp/B000GCGA4C">Amazon</a> seller account too, so if you'd prefer to order through Amazon's checkout you're free to do that (though you'll have to put up with a slightly higher price and no download). Speaking of Amazon, if anyone wouldn't mind dropping a quick review there, I'd hugely appreciate it (for any of my releases, not just Lemodie).</p>
<p>Anyway, I've ceremoniously updated the html in <a href="http://ochremusic.com/shop/">my shop</a> to mark this momentous occasion, and hereby declare Lemodie in stock and on sale. :)</p>

Well, some good news---<em>Lemodie</em> CDs will soon be back on the shelf.</p>
<p>At long last, after being out of print for over two years, I've finally managed to scrape together enough cash to organise a re-press of my 2006 sophomore album. It's being manufactured as I type by <a href="http://www.discmanufacturingservices.com/">DMS</a>, and shouldn't be longer than two or three weeks away, fingers crossed.</p>
<p>In preparation of its arrival, I'm taking pre-orders via Bandcamp <a href="http://ochre.bandcamp.com/album/lemodie">here</a>, which also covers an instant download in a variety of formats (I've also thrown in the CD hidden track as a bonus).</p>
<p>Now, I'm under no illusions as to how the market has changed in the past three/four years, and so have set the price at £6 plus P&P, which seems to me like the sweet-spot for CDs sans middleman.</p>
