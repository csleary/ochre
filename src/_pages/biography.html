<h1>Biography</h1>
<p>
  Ochre is the work of Christopher Leary, originally from England, currently based in Den Haag,
  Netherlands. He has been writing intricate electronic music since 2001, and has released on
  Toytronic, Benbecula Records, Village Green, Tramworks, Shipwrec, Lapsus, and Mystic and Quantum, in addition to his
  own
  <em>Aura Materia</em> imprint.
</p>
<p>
  Stylistically, his music is often highly melodic, described by the NME as being “full of
  shimmering electronics, crunchy, crispy beats and sweeping melancholic melodies that recall
  classic electronic stars such as Boards Of Canada,” with “analogue tones and glitchy beats &ndash;
  snatches of classical orchestration are peppered throughout, helping to create rich cinematic
  soundscapes.”
