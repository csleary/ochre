It's been quite a while since the first Snow Palms release, _Intervals_, way
back in 2012, so it's high time another idiophone-laden journey saw light of
day. [_Origin and Echo_](https://snowpalms.bandcamp.com/album/origin-and-echo)
is released today on the Village Green label.

Here's a video for _Rite_:

and vinyl editions also available.
