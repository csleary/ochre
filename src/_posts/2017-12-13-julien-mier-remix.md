Sydney-based Dutch artist, Julien Mier, has recently released a new EP on
Barcelona's Sin Hilo label.
[_Untangle the Roots_](https://sinhilo.bandcamp.com/album/julien-mier-untangle-the-roots)
includes my remix of Mier's track 'Well', and is one of four remixes capping-off
the 10-track EP.

As well as various digital options, it's also available as a beautifully designed
12" pressed on white vinyl, and sleeved in a delightful translucent printed
discobag. Excellent job on the design and packaging.

If you've never heard Julien's music before, you can expect playful, upbeat
tracks full of jazzy chords, found sound percussion and sunny melodies. Over to
