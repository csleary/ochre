If you'll excuse a little auto-backpattery, I was very pleasantly surprised to notice that the imminent 'Midsummer' 15th Anniv. repress is featured in [this week's Bandcamp Daily round up](https://daily.bandcamp.com/2019/06/07/bandcamp-essential-releases-june-7/). Thank you, Zoe Camp, for the lovely write up.

We're inside our last week of preordering now before Friday's release. [Head over to Bandcamp](https://bandcamp.ochremusic.com/album/a-midsummer-nice-dream-15th-anniversary-edition) if you fancy a copy.
