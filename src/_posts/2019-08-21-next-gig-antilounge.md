Next gig is in my adopted hometown of Den Haag (NL), playing at the release party for Foresense's new _Weerhaak_ EP on [Antilounge](http://antilounge.com/). About half of my set will be new material, so I'm looking forward to seeing how it plays out. I'll be on at approximately midnight.

Place/time: [Het Magazijn](https://goo.gl/maps/5pfQzn7qr4CiXHaq6), Thurs. 12th Sept., 11pm-4am, â‚¬5.

_Weerhaak_ features a remix from me, and will be out on tape and digital (first tape release I've been on, come to think of it). Keep an eye on the [Antilounge Bandcamp page](https://antilounge.bandcamp.com/) for release.
