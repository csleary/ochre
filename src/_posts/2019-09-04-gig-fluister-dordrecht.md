I've got another gig coming up soon as part of the Fluister series of events, taking place at the [Pictura](https://www.pictura.nl) venue in Dordrecht, on Saturday 21st September (doors 20:30).

In what might be a first for me, it'll be a very timely all-ambient affair (or at least beat-free -- there'll be plenty of melody), so I'll look forward to presenting a half hour of new and reworked tracks that I've been chipping away at recently.

Here's the [Facebook event](https://www.facebook.com/events/449454532491671/).
