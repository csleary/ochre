[This rather fetching slice of crème pâtissière-coloured vinyl](https://sinhilo.bandcamp.com/album/n-5) features a new track of mine, released via Barcelona's [Sin Hilo Recordings](https://www.sinhilo.com/). My track's vinyl-only, though I do believe vinyl purchases via Bandcamp still come with a download. Meanwhile, my Bandcamp [subscribers](https://bandcamp.ochremusic.com/) have access to a digital version as part of my growing Subscriber Singles collection, though it'll hopefully see a wider release later this year.
