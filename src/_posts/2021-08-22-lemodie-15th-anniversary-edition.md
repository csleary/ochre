Lapsus has kindly given _Lemodie_ a deluxe double vinyl 15th anniversary re-release, as part of their 'Perennial' series. The package features a wonderful design reimagining by Nathaniel Reeves, including a lithographic print using the palette of the original 2006 release to create a meander map for each track (check out Nate's excellent [art breakdown on Behance](https://www.behance.net/gallery/124964119/Ochre-Lemodie-15th-AE-2xLP)).

The tracklist includes four bonus tracks on the 'marbled garnet' vinyl, plus the pre-gap secret track from the original CD, as well as two digital bonus tracks, all from the same recording period.

You can preorder a copy now via [Bandcamp](https://bandcamp.ochremusic.com/album/lemodie-15th-anniversary-edition). More track snippets are available to stream on [SoundCloud](https://soundcloud.com/lapsus-records/ochre-lemodie-15th-anniversary-edition-perennial-series-10).
