Mystic and Quantum (who released my *Understory* EP a while back) are back with a new compilation featuring a track of mine. [*Whispers Of An Ancient World I*](https://mysticquantum.bandcamp.com/album/whispers-of-an-ancient-world-i) is set to be released on the 1st of December, on limited USB card (100 pcs.), download, and (hopefully) vinyl. The label is running a Bandcamp Campaign for the vinyl pressing, so if that's a format you'd like to see the compilation on, please pledge and help make it happen [here](https://mysticquantum.bandcamp.com/campaign/whispers-of-an-ancient-world-i).
